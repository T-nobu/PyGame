Subject: Test Report for Geometry Dash Game - Pytest Cases

I am pleased to report that all Pytest cases for the Geometry Dash Game have been executed successfully, indicating 
the robustness and correctness of the implemented functionality. The test suite covers various aspects of the game, 
including startup and final score menus, text drawing, collision detection, player movement, and game over scenarios.


1. Startup Menu:
   - The test for the startup menu, simulating the pressing of the Enter key, executed without errors.
   - The expected behavior of the application exiting after pressing Enter was confirmed.

2. Final Score Menu:
   - Tests for both quitting and playing again after reaching a final score executed without issues.
   - The expected outcomes were met, demonstrating the correct functionality of the final score menu.


3. Collision Detection:
   - Collision detection tests, both for cases with and without collisions, ran smoothly.
   - The logic for detecting collisions with obstacles from different directions (left, right, top, bottom) was validated.

4. Player Movement:
   - Tests for player jumping, collision during jumping, and player gravity executed without errors.
   - The expected changes in player state and movement were observed, ensuring proper player interaction.

5. Game Over:
   - Tests for game over scenarios, including collisions with obstacles and continuous gameplay without collisions, were successful.
   - The game over flag was appropriately set or cleared based on the simulation, indicating correct game flow.


In conclusion, the Pytest suite for the Geometry Dash Game has provided confidence in the correctness of the implemented features. 
All test cases have passed, indicating that the game functions as expected under various scenarios. The comprehensive testing approach, 
covering different aspects of the game, contributes to the reliability and stability of the application.As the developer, I am confident
in the robustness of the Geometry Dash Game, and the successful execution of the Pytest suite provides assurance that the codebase is well
tested and ready for further development or deployment.
